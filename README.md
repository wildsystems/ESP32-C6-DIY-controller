# ESP32-C6 Sensor Controller

## 📊 Description
This project is a basic controller built around the ESP32-C6-MINI-1, designed for monitoring and managing temperature, humidity, flow, and PWM-based sensors/actuators. It supports direct connection for four NTC thermistors, one DHT21 sensor, a 1-Wire bus with DS18B20, one pulse input for a Hall effect flow sensor, one PWM input, one PWM output, and two relay outputs. Additionally, it includes a USB-C connector for power and communication, supporting USB-CDC (virtual serial) and JTAG debugging.

## 📝 Notes

- All GPIOs used are considered safe for ESP32-C6-MINI-1 boot operation.
- NTC sensors are read via the internal ADC1.
- DHT21 requires at least a 2-second interval between readings.
- DS18B20 supports multiple sensors on a single 1-Wire bus.
- Flow sensor input should have a pull-up if not already onboard.
- PWM input can be measured using capture/timer functionality.
- PWM output can be generated via LEDC or MCPWM peripheral.
- Relay outputs can be connected to opto-isolated relay modules.
- USB-C port supports 5V input and USB communication (CDC, JTAG).
